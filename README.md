Connect 383

Connect 383 has three main differences from the connect 4. First, we will
not be limited to 6x7 boards. Secondly, games may start with one or more “obstacle” pieces
already on the board which do not belong to either player. Lastly, play will always continue 
until the board is completely full (even after a player has achieved 4-in-a-row).
For each streak of three or
more, the player will receive points equal to the square of the
length of that run.
